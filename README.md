# frequency_domain_adaptive_noise_cancellation

- Collaborated in a team of two for a course final project. 
- Primary(mic1) is the speech with the background noise that needs to be cleaned.
- Secondary(mic2) is just the noise. 
- Vary the N(Number of samples per frame) and mu(step size) values manually to suit your audio files.
- Observe the SNR and Error Convergence curves to select the optimum N and mu values.
